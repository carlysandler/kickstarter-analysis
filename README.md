## Overview of Project
*A Detailed Analysis of Arithmatic & Statistical Findings: Key Performance Trends, Visualizations, and Recommendations*
---
### Purpose
The purpose of the following project was to complete a thourough analysis on a Kickstart Crowdfunding data set, a sample population of 4000+ campaigns of varying categories and subgategories--performance is measured by the correlation between launch date and funding goals. 

The data set and brief were rovded by Louise, whom required the help of an analyst to understand the relativity of her personal fundraising success as her play, _Fever_, quickly received a large enough percentage of pledges to accomplish her fundraiding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
The following delinates the process of completing the analysis brief and providing insights to Louise:

  1) data wrathing of raw population sample through:
     * dynamic formulas using both arithmatic and statistical functions
     * custom sorting, filtering, and conditional formatting for optimal analytical capabilities
     
  - 2) analysis of the modified Kickstarter data set with:
     * pivot tables summarizing the campaign outcomes based on launch date and campaign goal ($$)
     * pivot charts formatted as line graphs to visualize the relationships

  - 3) explanation of findings based on analysis featuring:
     * concluding results
     * duligence of data set limitations
     * recommendations for supplemental tables and graphs
