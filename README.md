# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## Overview of Project
*A Detailed Analysis of Arithmatic & Statistical Findings: Key Performance Trends, Visualizations, and Recommendations*
---
### Purpose
The purpose of the following project was to complete a thourough analysis on a Kickstart Crowdfunding data set, a sample population of 4000+ campaigns of varying categories and subgategories--performance is measured by the correlation between launch date and funding goals. 

The data set and brief were rovded by Louise, whom required the help of an analyst to understand the relativity of her personal fundraising success as her play, _Fever_, quickly received a large enough percentage of pledges to accomplish her fundraiding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
The following delinates the process of completing the analysis brief and providing insights to Louise:

  - 1) data wrathing of raw population sample through:
     * dynamic formulas using both arithmatic and statistical functions
     * custom sorting, filtering, and conditional formatting for optimal analytical capabilities
     
  - 2) analysis of the modified Kickstarter data set with:
     * pivot tables summarizing the campaign outcomes based on launch date and campaign goal ($$)
     * pivot charts formatted as line graphs to visualize the relationship

  - 3) explanation of findings based on analysis featuring:
     * concluding results
     * duligence of data set limitations
     * recommendations for supplemental tables and graphs

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The line graph below shows the relationship between the Kickstarter campaign Launch Date, defined by the specific month the campaign launched in a 12 month calendar year. There are no subfilters on year, we are specifically looking at the correlation between the month of the launch date and the count of potential campaign outcomes, defined by: sucessful, failed, or canceled  categorized by month of launch date. Louise specifically interested in the "theater" parent category because her play belongs to this parent category.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are the two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we can create?
